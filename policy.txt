3. Data Storage & Security

All your personal logs (feelings, emotions, CBT entries, sleep, medications) are stored locally on your device, unless you explicitly choose to export them.

Data is encrypted in transit whenever sent over the network (for example, when using updates or backups).

We do not store or access your personal logs on our servers.

4. Data Sharing

Your personal log data is never shared with any third parties.

The only data that may be shared is:
	•	Crash/performance analytics, anonymized and aggregated
This contains no personal content and cannot identify you.

Mindstoria does not share or sell data for advertising or marketing.

⸻

5. Data Retention
	•	Your logs remain on your device until you delete the app or remove the data manually.
	•	If you export a backup, you are responsible for its storage.
	•	Crash analytics may be stored by third-party services (such as Expo or Google Play) for a limited time based on their policies.

⸻

6. Data Deletion Requests

Because Mindstoria does not require accounts and does not store your logs on servers:
	•	You can delete all your data by deleting the app from your device.
	•	If you have exported backups, delete those files manually.
